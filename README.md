#  gribParserTest

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>gribParser is a MacOS based software to convert 2D grib1 files to either ASCII time-series for individual (or groups of) locations or to binary 2D Tecplot fields. </p>
<p>gribParser was developed for a data set that had incorrectly set the GRIB code for rotated winds to false when the winds really were rotated. Therefore, rotation of wind vectors are under manual control. 
<p>gribParser uses the ECMWF <em>ECCodes</em>  (licenced under Apache v2.0) and the Tecplot, Inc., library <em>TecIO</em> </p>
